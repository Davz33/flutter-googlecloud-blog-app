## üì¶ Monorepo Structure

```
apps/
  frontend/   # Flutter web app (UI)
  backend/    # Dart server (API + static serving)
README.md     # You are here!
copy_web_build.sh # Build & copy script
```

---

## üñ•Ô∏è Frontend: Flutter Web
- All your UI code lives in `apps/frontend`.
- Build with: `flutter build web`
- Output is copied to the backend for serving.

## üõ†Ô∏è Backend: Dart Server
- Located in `apps/backend`.
- Uses [`shelf`](https://pub.dev/packages/shelf) to serve static files and API endpoints.
- Serves the built web app from the `/static` directory.
- Ready for Google Cloud Run or local Docker.

## üö¢ Deployment

### 1. **Build the Web App**
```bash
./copy_web_build.sh
```

### 2. **Run Locally with Docker**
```bash
cd apps/backend
# Build and run
docker build -t blog-backend .
docker run -p 8080:8080 blog-backend
```

### 3. **Deploy to Google Cloud Run**
- Make sure you have the [gcloud CLI](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install) installed and authenticated.
- From `apps/backend`:
```bash
gcloud run deploy --source .
```
